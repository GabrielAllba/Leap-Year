## Project Prompt
Write a leap_year.cpp program that:

- Takes a year as input.
- Checks to see if the year is a four-digit number.
- Displays whether or not the year falls on a leap year.

There are 3 criteria that must be taken into account to identify a leap year:

- If the year can be evenly divided by 4 then it is a leap year, howeverâ€¦
- If that year can be evenly divided by 100, and it is not evenly divided by 400, then it is NOT a leap year.
- If that year is evenly divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.

Take some time to research and brainstorm before starting to write the code!
## Technologies

- C++
